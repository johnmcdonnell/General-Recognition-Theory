General Recognition Theory
==========================

This is a Python implementation of a subset of the tools used in General
Recognition Theory. It is based on the GRT toolboox for Matlab by Leola
Alfonso-Reese, hosted on `her website
<http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~leola/toolbox.html>`_. I was working on porting it
over to Python for my own research, and realized I should make my efforts
public. 

System requirements
-------------------
The code here requires Python 2.x (availible `here <http://python.org>`_) with
the numpy and scipy libraries (availible `here <http://numpy.org>`_).

minimal changes to the Matlab files, focusing instead on porting the code over
to Python. Work by me (all the python files) is copyrighted by me, but I assent
