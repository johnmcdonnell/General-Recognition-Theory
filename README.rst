General Recognition Theory
==========================

General Recognition Theory is a multi-dimensional version of signal detection theory (Thurstone, 1927; Green & Swets, 1966). It was developed by psychologists (Ashby & Townsend, 1986; Ashby & Gott, 1988) to study the human categorization process. 

General Recognition Theory (hereafter GRT) is a model developed by Ashby and
collaborators (Ashby & Townsend, 1986; Ashby & Gott, 1988) as a Psychologically
realistic thoery of how humans might derive boundaries through stimulus space
for the purpose of categorization. It is essentially a multi-dimensional
version of signal detection theory [`wiki <https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Signal_detection_theory>`_].


What is this doing here?
-----------------------

I have forked a lovely Matlab toollbox put together by Leola Alfonso-Reese. She
has it hosted on `her website
<http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~leola/toolbox.html>`_. I was working on moving it
over to Python for my own research, and realized I should make my efforts
public. All files are marked internally with copyright information. I have made
minimal changes to the Matlab files, focusing instead on porting the code over
to Python. Work by me (all the python files) is copyrighted by me, but I assent
to copying for personal or academic reasons.
