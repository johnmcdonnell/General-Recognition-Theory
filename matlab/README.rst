General Recognition Theory Toolbox
==========================

This folder contains a fork of the General Recognition Theory toolbox put
together by Leola Alfonso-Reese. It is available on `her website
<http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~leola/toolbox.html>`_. I was working on moving it
over to Python for my own research, and realized I should make my efforts
public. All files are marked internally with copyright information. I have made
minimal changes to the Matlab files, focusing instead on porting the code over
to Python.

**WARNING**: In porting this project to Python, I have discovered that the
fitting method provided here does not always provide the best fit. In fact,
sometimes the fits it provides are qualitatively different from the true fits,
as when a fit constrained to use only one stimuus dimension appears to be a
much worse fit than one that is allowed to use two stimulus dimensions when in
fact a fit on one dimension can be found that is nearly as good as the fit on
two dimensions.
