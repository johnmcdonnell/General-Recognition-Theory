General Recognition Theory Toolbox
==========================

This folder contains a fork of the General Recognition Theory toolbox put
together by Leola Alfonso-Reese. It is available on `her website
<http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~leola/toolbox.html>`_. I was working on moving it
over to Python for my own research, and realized I should make my efforts
public. All files are marked internally with copyright information. I have made
minimal changes to the Matlab files, focusing instead on porting the code over
to Python.
